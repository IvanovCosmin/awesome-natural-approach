# What is this?
This is just that contains as many language learning resources as possible.
They can be described as using: Natural approach, Comprihensible input or TPRS.

This is made with the help of our fellows here on [r\languagelearning](www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/)

If I made any mistakes, please create a pull request with the needed fixes or create an issue.
I haven't personally verified all of them.
You are more than welcome to make improvements.

# Other useful links
[LANGUAGE LINKS DATABASE](https://universeofmemory.com/language-links-database/)
Lots of other resources for many languages.

[FluentU](https://www.fluentu.com/)
Paid app. Has lots of videos translated in Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese, German, Japanese, English, Italian, Russian, and Korean. Worth getting the trial and then deciding for yourself.

[Beelinguapp](https://www.beelinguapp.com/)
Has texts in many languages, translated into english. Really great resource for reading, listening and translating. It has Spanish, English, German, Portuguese, Korean, French, Hindi, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, Arabic, Italian and Japanese. Has a paid version, but the paid one is ok.

[Drops](https://languagedrops.com/)
Learn vocabulary using images. This may be good for more advanced users. I personally don't recommend buying it unless you are more advanced in the target language.

[TED](https://www.ted.com/)
Very useful because you can find transcripts of the talks in the target language. Watching it once in English and then reading in the target language may help you develop comprehension.

Assimil
Both the app and the books may help you a lot. It is worth trying
